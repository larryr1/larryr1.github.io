## About Me
Ever since I was old enough to use a computer, I had interests that came and went, as everyone does. However, one interest lingered, which was seeking the answer to **how does box this of circut boards work?**

Eventually, that interest expressed itself in the form of programming. I began tinkering in Chrome on school computers in the Inspect Element window, writing my own little sites with pages and tricking my friends into thinking I deleted google.
One of the first programs I ever wrote was a calculator in the form of a batch script, on a Windows Vista laptop my grandmother had given me.

I began to take on more advanced projects, with the aim of discovering new technologies and wanting to see my own creation appear on someone else's screen. I developed my first large project in 8th grade, the Patrol Leaders Council Database.
